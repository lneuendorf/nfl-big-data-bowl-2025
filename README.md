1. plotting
    1. create process to generate and save many plots to icloud
    2. clean up plotting code
2. look into plays where there are motions and shifts, do defenders shift in response? Do they shift to fill gaps?


# Notes:
* The motion and shift events are human tagged, whereas the motion and shift binary player play columns are tagged via a rule-based process
