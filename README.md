# Todo
1. plotting
    1. create process to generate and save many plots to icloud
    2. clean up plotting code
    3. plot dots with orientation and color by position
2. look into plays where there are motions and shifts, do defenders shift in response? Do they shift to fill gaps?


# Notes:
* The motion and shift events are human tagged, whereas the motion and shift binary player play columns are tagged via a rule-based process

2022100903, 2974 - good shift play where defense stays is gap sound -> inside run no gain
2022101610, 2602 - mistagged - event has shift, when it was motion
